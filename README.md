Aqua Protocol: Key Concepts (Intro)
 General Context:
 Aqua Protocol falls into the broader field of Data Governance, where managing, securing, and ensuring the integrity of data is critical. To 
facilitate governance, it's crucial to reference and quantify data. This is achieved through hashes, which serve as unique identifiers that can 
be verified to represent the data itself. Aqua Protocol takes the concept of hash-verification further, developing it into a comprehensive 
approach for general data accounting and governance.
 The primary objective of Aqua Protocol is to enable the creation of cheap, verifiable datasets while also offering a quick and automated 
method for verification. To maximaze a contribution to digital trust, low effort creation of verifiable datasets in combination with automated 
and fast verification is essential.
 Introduction:
 How would it look if we added cryptographic metadata to any file of choice to improve its trustworthiness? This is typically done when you 
upload a file, for example, to a blockchain, such as with NFTs. However, this approach is costly, not performant, and also compromises the 
privacy of the file.
 With the Aqua pilot implementations (Personal Knowledge Container and Guardian), we've demonstrated that there's 
no need to use a 
distributed ledger technology to achieve same level of trust or to share the file with a third party or upload it to a network.
 Instead, the addition of cryptographic metadata can be done locally on the machine or via a service that does not expose the file to third 
parties (other than the service provider, if provided as a service). 
Furthermore, cryptographic signatures can be applied independently of a blockchain, using crypto-wallets off-chain (both hardware and 
software), while benefiting from the extensive development this infrastructure enjoys due to its use in high-stakes environments for buying, 
selling, and trading cryptocurrencies.
 We adopt hash-chains which link every state of the file to its previous revision, creating immutable historical records for the file and 
protecting it against manipulation or corruption (Data Provanance). These hash-chains are also referred to in this writing as Aqua-chains.
 If higher security then sigantures are required in a workflow, cryptographic timestamping to a ledger can be done to inherit a proof of 
existance and with it the same transaction security as on-chain transactions by storing and verifing (aggregated) the aqua-chain verification 
hash in a smart-contract.
 Aqua-files are automatically verified using aqua-verifier implementations within the software or as standalone software tools. Verification 
time must be very short to create frictionless trust with the data being interacted with.
 Aqua Protocol is structured around four core functionalities for digital accountability:
 1. Integrity Verification: Uses portable hash-chains to create an immutable history of changes, ensuring data integrity.
 2. Digital Signatures: Employs Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or DID Signing for security. Private keys add a layer of authentication, 
confirming that only the owner can sign. Ethereum Wallet usage: Utilizes Ethereum public keys for accountability due to their supported 
open development and wide range of available hard and software wallets. They are providing a collision-free namespace by default. The 
protocol can support different types of signatures, we have implemented Ethereum and DID signatures for reference but this could 
include potential integration with governmental IDs or corporate smart cards.
 a. We assume that there was a sufficiently strong key identification and registration process before using signatures within a legal 
context, as this is a pre-requisit to have a legal binding between the signature and a document
 b. If a secret wallet key is secure and not compromised we can eventually derrive with Non-Repudiation, especially if the data is 
Witnessed with a Proof of Existance and clean and audited implementations of a mature software implementation. A short 
description what “Non-Repudiation” is according to this source (excerp):
“Non-repudiation is a security concept that ensures that a party involved in a digital transaction cannot deny the authenticity of their 
actions or the content of the transaction. In essence, it prevents the sender of a message or the initiator of a transaction from later 
denying their involvement or the validity of the transaction. Key characteristics of non-repudiation include:
 Immutable Records: Non-repudiation mechanisms create records or evidence of transactions that are tamper-evident and 
irrefutable.
 Authentication and Authorization: Non-repudiation often involves strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to 
establish the identity of the parties involved.
 Digital Signatures: Digital signatures are a common tool used to achieve non-repudiation, as they provide a cryptographic proof 
of the sender’s identity and intent.”
 3. Timestamping/Witnessing: Incorporates public blockchains like Ethereum for timestamping, creating Proof of Existence or using an 
Authoritative Party as per TSA_RFC3161. This enhances security by linking the Aqua-chain's latest verification hash to Ethereum's smart 
contracts, thus extending the main-chain's security.
 Proof of Existence: Ensures digital assets can be proven to exist without public disclosure, useful for IP protection in research or 
proving the originality of digital content.
 4. Verifiable Linking: Allows for stateful linkage to files or Aqua-chains, maintaining file history and integrity. This feature supports the 
creation of networks of digitally linked assets, enforceable through verifiable links to licenses and contracts.
 Conclusion of the four basic principles:
 The Aqua protocol can ensure data integrity, digital signing and proof of existence (PoF) as well as stateful linking (linking a verifiable 
resource) as described above. Those capabilities allow to establish various trusted workflows given the precondition that there is a secure 
key handling through wallets and that the wallets are either explicitly used (with user-interaction) or that the application the user utilizes does 
the signing in the background.
 these four principles enable a broad spectrum of applications, from document management to digital asset collections with linked, 
enforceable licenses and policies, as demonstrated in our Pilot (PKC + Guardian).
 Other usecases can be used to e.g. notarize data origin to combat unaccounted generated datasets through AI deep-fakes

Data Structure:
The Pilot which was developed for POSSIBLE (a GAIA-X research project), the above diagram with a pair of Personal-Knowledge
Containers and Guardians. The Container which stores the data (PKCs) and secures the uploaded data to the containers with the Aqua
Protocol turning it into Aqua-Chains and the Guardian which acts as an enforcement point and verification point. The Guardian is also used 
to establishing secure connections between other Guardian's. Users and Guardians are identified through public keys which are managed 
by wallets. 
The Guardian was the new component developed during the POSSIBLE Project in 2024 while the initial version of the PKC (initial version 
2022) was upgraded to meet the requirements.
 Note: Aqua Protocol uses cryptographic principles like hash-chains and wallets (which are shared with Distributed-Ledger-Technologies 
(DLT)) but is NOT a DLT. Local storage secures datasets by adding Aqua-cryptographic metadata; no data is stored on the Ethereum 
Blockchain except for file hashes when using the cryptographic timestamping service (proof of existence), which isn't used in the linked 
Guardian demo.
 Prototypes showcase Aqua Protocol's data verification capabilities. Learnings from these prototypes enhance the Aqua Protocol. As a 
middleware solution, judgments often focus on the prototypes, we ask to kindly consider, these pilots leverage the underlying datastructure, 
allowing for varied implementation decisions while maintaining the same shared protocol's core structure.

instance via E-mail to tim.bansemer@inblock.io which you can also use for any request regarding this documentation.
Application: 
The pilot has showcased how to use a form of contract / consent management to manage access to verifiable datasets. This solves the 
foundational business requirements to be able to:
 Trade Data which clear reference, tracablility (delivery receipts) and audibility
 Provide verifiable data assets for various applications including audits and compliance requirements
 Automated access and enforcement based on policies provided alongside the data asset
 Aqua-Contracts
 The new capabilities which we introduced with the Guardian is the proof of concept to use Aqua-Chains as automatically enforcable 
contracts.
 Those contracts are based on mediawiki-templates which are also secured by Aqua (defacto aqua-chains) which are versioned and 
represented by a verification hash. When a contract is created a new page is used to create an instance of a contract by linking back to the 
template.
 Any page used for Access control or to establish trust between Guardians (so called Aqua-Contracts) is created and stored within the PKC. 
When a contract is negotiated for access, the contract is stored with both parties as the data is exchanged between the PKCs through the 
Guardians as shown in the Demo.
 The following two data sharing methods are used between Guardians to exchange data between PKC’s:
 Data Access (Unidirectional Sharing): Contract based on consent by the sharing party to share a resource with another party. The 
contract is enforced once a valid signature is detected.
 Data Access Agreement (Bidirectional Sharing): Contract which needs to be bilaterally signed to share a resource with another party. 
This requires a contract workflow, where the contract is created, automatically transferred to the other party, counter-signed on the 
proposed contract which is then automatically transferred back to the sending party and enforced, allowing sharing of the resource in 
question. The same workflow can be re-purposed to handle any form of back-and-forth contract signing. The contract contains a "Terms" 
field which can be filled with arbitrary data, allowing any form of basic agreement to be formed between the two parties in question. This 
is what is shown in the Demo.
 Note: Signed Delivery Receipts are not yet implemented in the Guardians, but could be useful in those cases where there needs to be a 
receipt that the data was received/delivered. The delivery receipts would be issued with the signature of the guardian after a resource has 
been received, verified and stored into storage (PKC), to then issue a new page containing the delivery receipt from the receiving party. The 
delivery receipt would be requested by the party as part of the conditions set in the Data Access Agreement.
 The capabilities required for the Guardian to issue a delivery receipt have already been proven and implemented with the “Servitude
Contract” which is a page, which is generated, stored and signed within the PKC by the Guardian.
 Policy Access Managment:
 We conducted an initial assessment to determine whether we could address various policy requirements within the framework of 
international data spaces, according to the policy classes defined in those spaces and in relation to the ODRL policy offer model (referenced 
at https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#policy-offer ).
 We examined the capabilities of the Aqua-Protocol's approach, which uses distributed system components (Guardians + Aqua Storage 
Containers + Wallets), to see if all relational structures could be adequately expressed. We found no policy classes that could not be 
enforced using this approach.
 Particularly, we focused on endpoint enforcement, as this aspect would necessitate complete control over endpoints, which presents 
challenges regarding sovereignty and privacy, especially for consumers.
 Results:
 Policy Classes - GaiaX (1).xlsx 
Licenses and Policies as Trustless Linked Data Structures
 An innovative aspect of this approach is to present licenses and policies as verified linked data alongside the original data asset. This setup 
ensures that "linking them" is done in such a way that any separation would make the asset unverifiable, and therefore, untrustable.
 When a data publisher stipulates in their agreements that all datasets which are not verifiable are considered illegitimate, this could serve as 
a worthwhile strategy to prevent the commercial use of unaccounted data. It would clearly indicate license violations if data is provided 
without the verification context. Therefore holding not clearly accounted data turns into a liability creating an incentive to not do so.
 Aqua Components
 Wallets
 Not a component developed by us but listed as a critical component which is used throughout our infrastructure and provides a corner-stone 
for all security and trust assumptions.
 Note: Wallet in the Aqua-Context mean cryptographic-wallets being usally used for cryptocurrencies. Its a software or hardware wallet used 
for  secure key management. The sole purpose of this wallet is the secure key management of the private keys and to provide an interface 
for securely signing transactions. The wallet does not store data, this is done in the Aqua-context with containers (of which the PKC is one) 
which hold the data, verifies the data and allows for turning normal files into Aqua-chains. 
The wallets seen in the demonstration is https://metamask.io/  but any Ethereum compatible wallet works. We also tested Phantom Wallet 
and using Hardware Wallets with Ledger (here is a demo from 3 years ago with the initial prototype of the PKC - Using a Hardware Wallet).
 Personal Knowledge Container (PKC) 
The following components are developed by http://inblock.io  assets GmbH as open source.
 Personal-Knowledge-Container is a Mediawiki Aqua Implementation. Acts as a container to store and provide Aqua-Chains (files that have 
been enveloped in cryptographic metadata to secure them). Any page created within the PKC is enriched with cryptographic metadata 
turning them into Aqua-chains in the background. This is also true for any file uploaded to a PKC.
 The PKC consists of four docker-containers forming togather the PKC bundled within a deployment script:
 MediaWiki Container with an Aqua Extension
 SQL Database (for mediawiki) which stores all data of the PKC (Aqua-Chains, MW-Pages)
 SIWE-OIDC (Sigle-Sign-On-With-Ethereum acting as an OIDC provider)
 REDIS (a session database for SIWE-OIDC)

Guardian
 A software written in Rust that includes an Aqua-verifier, a wallet, and the capability to read a storage container for Aqua-Chains / files 
(specifically, the PKC)
 Guardian Implementation in Rust:
 Reads all the files within the PKC and cryptographically verifies integrity, signatures and timestamps of all Aqua-Chains
 Detects potential contracts based on predefined templates
 Executes these contracts if the validity conditions are met
 verify all aqua-chains which are exchanged (incoming data streams) and only stores them in the PKC when valid
 The Guardian reads all pages within the PKC and builds a local state of all those pages within the memory. Below is a systemsdiagram of 
the Guardian showing all interfaces and components with related functions. Aqua-Chains are handled as hash-chains which required a logic 
capable of handling forking, merging and related conflict resolutions within the PKC. An extensive documentation of the workings of the 
Guardian can be found in the public project documentation on Github, which is linked here for easy use.
 Basic Guardian Components diagram:
 Note: The eth-lookup module is not used within the Demo. It is only used if Aqua-chains have been cryptographically timestamped to 
perform a Proof-of-Existance (PoF) to notarize the data.
